# Financial Document Analyzer - Debug Assignment

## Project Overview
A comprehensive financial document analysis system that processes corporate reports, financial statements, and investment documents using AI-powered analysis agents.

## Getting Started

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<!-- FIXED: Changed from requirement.txt to requirements.txt -->

### Sample Document
The system analyzes financial documents like Tesla's Q2 2025 financial update.

**To add Tesla's financial document:**
1. Download the Tesla Q2 2025 update from: https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf
2. Save it as `data/sample.pdf` in the project directory
3. Or upload any financial PDF through the API endpoint

**Note:** Current `data/sample.pdf` is a placeholder - replace with actual Tesla financial document for proper testing.
